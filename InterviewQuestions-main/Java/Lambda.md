Certainly! Here are a few problem statements that you can practice solving using lambda expressions in Java:

1. Filter Even Numbers: Write a program that takes a list of integers and uses a lambda expression to filter out and print only the even numbers.

2. Calculate Average: Write a program that takes a list of integers and uses a lambda expression to calculate and print the average of those numbers.

3. Sort Strings: Write a program that takes a list of strings and uses a lambda expression to sort them in ascending order based on their lengths.

4. Find Palindromes: Write a program that takes a list of strings and uses a lambda expression to filter and print only the palindromic strings.

5. Transform Strings: Write a program that takes a list of strings and uses a lambda expression to transform each string to uppercase and print the resulting list.

6. Find Maximum Value: Write a program that takes a list of integers and uses a lambda expression to find and print the maximum value in the list.

7. Group by Length: Write a program that takes a list of strings and uses a lambda expression to group them based on their lengths and print the groups.

8. Remove Duplicates: Write a program that takes a list of strings and uses a lambda expression to remove duplicates and print the resulting list.

9. Calculate Factorials: Write a program that takes a list of integers and uses a lambda expression to calculate and print the factorial of each number.

10. Count Words: Write a program that takes a list of strings and uses a lambda expression to count and print the number of words in each string.

These problems will give you a good opportunity to practice using lambda expressions for filtering, transforming, sorting, and performing various operations on collections in Java.
