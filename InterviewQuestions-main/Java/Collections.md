## **1. What is the difference between Set And List?**

- In Java, both Set and List are interfaces that are used to store collections of elements. However, there are some key
  differences between the two:

1. **Ordering**: The primary difference between Set and List is the order of the elements. In a List, the elements are
   stored in a specific order, which means that you can access them by their index. In a Set, there is no specific order
   for the elements.
2. **Duplicates**: Another key difference is that Sets do not allow duplicate elements, while Lists can contain
   duplicate elements.
3. **Implementation**: Sets and Lists are typically implemented differently in Java. The most common implementation of
   Set is HashSet, which is based on a hash table. On the other hand, ArrayList is a popular implementation of List,
   which uses an array to store the elements.
4. **Usage**: Sets are typically used when you need to store unique elements, or when you need to check if an element
   exists in a collection. Lists are typically used when you need to access elements by their index or when you need to
   maintain a specific order.

## **2. How does Set avoids duplicated elements?**

- In a HashSet, the buckets are implemented as an array of linked lists. When an element is added to the Set, the
  implementation first calculates the hash code for the element. It then uses the hash code to determine the index of
  the array in which the element should be stored. If there is no linked list at that index yet, a new linked list is
  created, and the element is added to the list. If there is already a linked list at that index, the implementation
  searches the list to see if the element already exists. If the element is already in the list, it is not added again.
  If the element is not in the list, it is added to the end of the list.

- One of the advantages of using hashing is that it allows for efficient lookup and retrieval of elements. When you want
  to check whether an element exists in a HashSet, the implementation first calculates the hash code for the element. It
  then uses the hash code to determine which bucket the element should be in, and searches the linked list in that
  bucket for the element. Since the hash code uniquely identifies the bucket, the implementation can quickly narrow down
  the search to a small number of elements, making the lookup very efficient.

---

## **3. How the objects are inserted in SET/LIST? - Insertion fashion**

- Inserting into a Set:
    - When an element is added to a Set, the Set implementation first checks whether the element already exists in the
      Set by calling the equals() method on the new element and each existing element in the Set. If the equals() method
      returns true, the Set implementation does not add the new element since it already exists in the Set. If the
      equals() method returns false, the Set implementation adds the new element to the Set.
- Inserting into a List:
    - When an element is added to a List, the List implementation adds the new element to the end of the List by
      default. If an index is specified, the List implementation inserts the new element at that index, and shifts all
      subsequent elements to the right to make room for the new element. If the List implementation needs to resize the
      underlying array that stores the List elements, it may need to create a new array, copy the existing elements into
      the new array, and then add the new element to the new array.

--- 

## **4. How the keys and values (objects) are inserted in HashMap? - Insertion fashion**


- In a `HashMap`, both keys and values are inserted in a specific fashion.

- When a key-value pair is added to the `HashMap`, the key's hash code is first computed. The hash code is then used to determine the bucket where the key-value pair will be stored.

- A bucket is essentially an index in the underlying array used to implement the `HashMap`. The bucket is computed by taking the hash code of the key and performing a modulo operation on the number of buckets in the array. This ensures that the bucket index is within the bounds of the array.

- Once the bucket is determined, the key-value pair is inserted into that bucket. If the bucket already contains a key-value pair, the new pair is inserted at the head of a linked list that is maintained for that bucket.

- If the number of key-value pairs in the `HashMap` exceeds a certain threshold, the `HashMap` is resized by creating a larger array and rehashing all the key-value pairs into the new array. This is necessary to maintain the desired level of performance.

- In summary, the keys and values in a `HashMap` are inserted by first computing the key's hash code, determining the appropriate bucket for the key-value pair, and then inserting the pair into the bucket. If the bucket already contains a key-value pair, the new pair is inserted at the head of a linked list. If the number of key-value pairs exceeds a certain threshold, the `HashMap` is resized.

## **5. Set vs Map in Java**

**Q:** What is the difference between a Set and a Map in Java?

**A:** A Set and a Map are both collection interfaces in Java, but they differ in their implementation and the way they store and retrieve elements:

1. A Set is a collection of unique elements. It does not allow duplicates, and the order of the elements is not guaranteed. A Set can be implemented using the `HashSet` class, which stores the elements in a hash table for fast retrieval.

2. A Map is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, and each key maps to a single value. The order of the key-value pairs is not guaranteed. A Map can be implemented using the `HashMap` class, which stores the key-value pairs in a hash table for fast retrieval.

**Q:** What are the common methods available in both Set and Map interfaces?

**A:** Both Set and Map interfaces provide common methods to add, remove, and retrieve elements:

1. `add(element)` method is used to add an element to a Set.

2. `put(key, value)` method is used to add a key-value pair to a Map.

3. `remove(element)` method is used to remove an element from a Set.

4. `remove(key)` method is used to remove a key-value pair from a Map.

5. `contains(element)` method is used to check if an element is present in a Set.

6. `containsKey(key)` method is used to check if a key is present in a Map.

7. `containsValue(value)` method is used to check if a value is present in a Map.

**Q:** When should we use a Set, and when should we use a Map?

**A:** We should use a Set when we want to store a collection of unique elements, and we do not care about the order of the elements. We should use a Map when we want to store a collection of key-value pairs, and we want to be able to retrieve the value associated with a key quickly. In general, we should use a Set when we do not need to associate any additional data with the elements, and we should use a Map when we need to associate additional data with each element.

**Q:** Can we have duplicate keys in a Map?

**A:** No, we cannot have duplicate keys in a Map. Each key must be unique, and each key maps to a single value. If we try to insert a key-value pair with a key that already exists in the Map, the old value associated with that key will be replaced by the new value.

## **6. Set Data Structure in Java**

**Q:** What is a Set data structure in Java, and what are its uses?

**A:** A Set is a collection data structure in Java that is used to store unique elements. In other words, a Set does not allow duplicates. It is an unordered collection of objects, and it can store any type of objects, including null values.

The Set data structure is used in various areas of computer science, including:

- Removing duplicates: the Set data structure can be used to remove duplicate elements from a collection of objects
- Membership testing: the Set data structure can be used to check whether a particular element exists in a collection or not
- Mathematical set operations: the Set data structure can be used to perform union, intersection, and difference operations between sets
- Caching: the Set data structure can be used to cache the results of expensive computations, so that they can be reused in future computations

In Java, the Set data structure is implemented using the Set interface, which extends the Collection interface. There are three main implementations of the Set interface in Java:

1. HashSet: a HashSet uses a hash table to store elements, and it provides constant-time performance for the basic operations like add, remove, and contains, assuming that the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets.
2. TreeSet: a TreeSet stores elements in a sorted order, and it provides logarithmic-time performance for the basic operations like add, remove, and contains. However, the ordering affects the performance of the operations.
3. LinkedHashSet: a LinkedHashSet is similar to a HashSet, but it maintains the insertion order of the elements, which makes it slightly slower than a HashSet.

Apart from these, there are other Set implementations in Java, like EnumSet and CopyOnWriteArraySet, that have specific use cases.

---
## **7. Java: Diff between HashMap/HashSet/HashTable?**

- HashTable is a synchronized class, which means it is thread-safe, while HashMap and HashSet are not. This means that
  if multiple threads access a HashTable instance simultaneously, the access is synchronized and there will be no data
  inconsistency issues. However, this can also cause a performance overhead.

- HashMap allows null values for both keys and values, while HashTable does not allow null for either keys or values.

- HashSet is an implementation of the Set interface, which means it does not allow duplicates, while both HashMap and
  HashTable are implementations of the Map interface, which means they allow duplicate keys, but not duplicate values.

- HashMap and HashSet are not synchronized, which makes them more efficient than HashTable in cases where you do not
  need thread safety. However, this also means that if multiple threads access a HashMap or HashSet instance
  simultaneously, data inconsistency issues may occur.

- HashTable is considered a legacy class and has been largely replaced by HashMap, which is faster and more efficient.
  HashSet is commonly used when you need to store a collection of unique elements.

--- 

## 8. Difference between TreeSet and HashSet

**Q:** What is the difference between a TreeSet and a HashSet in Java?

**A:** Both TreeSet and HashSet are implementations of the Set interface in Java, but they have different characteristics. The main differences between the two are:

- **Ordering**: TreeSet maintains elements in sorted order, whereas HashSet does not maintain any specific order.
- **Performance**: HashSet generally performs faster than TreeSet for adding, removing, and checking for the presence of elements, but TreeSet is generally faster for searching and iterating over the elements.
- **Duplicates**: Both TreeSet and HashSet do not allow duplicates.

**Q:** How does TreeSet maintain sorted order?

**A:** TreeSet maintains sorted order using a Red-Black Tree data structure. When elements are added to a TreeSet, they are inserted into the tree in their natural ordering, according to the Comparable or Comparator provided. The elements are then re-balanced to maintain the Red-Black Tree properties, which ensures that the tree remains balanced and efficient for searching and iterating over the elements.

**Q:** How does HashSet check for the presence of duplicates?

**A:** HashSet checks for the presence of duplicates by using the hashCode() and equals() methods of the elements. When an element is added to a HashSet, its hashCode() method is called to determine its hash code, which is used to determine the bucket in which the element will be stored. If there is already an element in the same bucket with the same hash code, the equals() method is called to determine if the elements are equal. If they are equal, the new element is not added to the HashSet.

**Q:** Which implementation should I use, TreeSet or HashSet?

**A:** The choice between TreeSet and HashSet depends on the specific requirements of your application. If you need to maintain elements in sorted order, TreeSet is the best choice. If you need fast performance for adding, removing, and checking for the presence of elements, HashSet is generally the better choice. If you need to search or iterate over the elements frequently, TreeSet may be faster. However, it's always a good idea to benchmark your specific use case to determine which implementation performs best.

## 9. Stack Data Structure in Java

**Q:** What is a Stack data structure in Java, and what are its uses?

**A:** A Stack is a linear data structure in Java that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is a collection of elements, where elements can be inserted or removed only from one end, called the top of the stack. The elements are stored in the stack in a sequential manner, and the most recently inserted element is always placed on the top of the stack.

The two main operations that can be performed on a Stack are:

- Push: adds an element to the top of the stack
- Pop: removes the element from the top of the stack

Apart from these, a Stack also supports some other operations like Peek, Search, isEmpty, etc.

The Stack data structure is used in various areas of computer science, including:

- Memory management: the call stack in programming languages uses the stack data structure to store function calls and local variables
- Expression evaluation: the stack data structure can be used to evaluate postfix and prefix expressions
- Undo/Redo functionality: the stack data structure can be used to implement the undo/redo functionality in various applications
- Browser history: the back and forward functionality in web browsers can be implemented using a stack data structure
- Function call tracking: the stack data structure can be used to keep track of function calls in a program

In Java, the Stack data structure is implemented using the Stack class, which extends the Vector class. However, it is recommended to use the Deque interface and its implementations, such as ArrayDeque or LinkedList, instead of the Stack class, as they offer better performance and more functionality.

---

## 10. Queue Data Structure in Java

**Q:** What is a Queue data structure 
In Java, a Queue is a data structure that stores a collection of elements in a particular order. The queue follows the "First-In-First-Out" (FIFO) principle, where the element that is added first is the first one to be removed. The elements are added to the end of the queue, and they are removed from the front of the queue.

The `java.util.Queue` interface is part of the Java Collections Framework and provides several methods for working with queues. Some of the commonly used methods include:

- `add(element)`: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
- `offer(element)`: Adds an element to the end of the queue and returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful.
- `remove()`: Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue. Throws a `NoSuchElementException` if the queue is empty.
- `poll()`: Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue, or returns `null` if the queue is empty.
- `element()`: Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it. Throws a `NoSuchElementException` if the queue is empty.
- `peek()`: Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it, or returns `null` if the queue is empty.

Queues are commonly used in various computer algorithms and simulations, and in messaging systems where messages need to be processed in the order they are received. Some of the specific uses of a Queue data structure in Java include:

- Implementing a breadth-first search algorithm.
- Implementing a caching system where the least recently used items are evicted first.
- Implementing a messaging system where messages are processed in the order they are received.
- Implementing a task queue where tasks are executed in the order they are added.

## 11. Difference between HashMap and Concurrent HashMap?

`HashMap` and `ConcurrentHashMap` are both classes in Java that implement the `Map` interface and are used to store key-value pairs. However, there are significant differences between them, especially when it comes to their behavior in multi-threaded environments.

1. **Thread-Safety:**
   - `HashMap`: `HashMap` is not thread-safe, meaning it is not designed to be used in multi-threaded scenarios without external synchronization. If accessed by multiple threads simultaneously, it can lead to undefined behavior and potential data corruption.
   - `ConcurrentHashMap`: `ConcurrentHashMap` is specifically designed for multi-threaded environments. It provides a higher level of thread-safety compared to `HashMap`. Multiple threads can read and write concurrently without the need for external synchronization. It achieves this by dividing the data into segments and allowing concurrent access to different segments.

2. **Performance:**
   - `HashMap`: In a single-threaded environment, `HashMap` can be more efficient due to its simpler internal structure. However, when accessed concurrently, the need for external synchronization can lead to performance bottlenecks.
   - `ConcurrentHashMap`: In a multi-threaded environment, `ConcurrentHashMap` can provide better performance by allowing concurrent read and write operations on different segments. This can lead to improved throughput compared to a synchronized `HashMap`.

3. **Iterator Behavior:**
   - `HashMap`: The iterators provided by a `HashMap` are fail-fast, which means they throw a `ConcurrentModificationException` if the map is modified while an iterator is traversing it.
   - `ConcurrentHashMap`: The iterators provided by a `ConcurrentHashMap` are weakly consistent, meaning they will not throw exceptions if the map is modified while being iterated. They provide a view of the map as it existed when the iterator was created.

4. **Null Values and Keys:**
   - Both `HashMap` and `ConcurrentHashMap` allow `null` values.
   - However, `ConcurrentHashMap` does not allow `null` keys. Attempting to insert a `null` key will result in a `NullPointerException`.

5. **Usage:**
   - Use `HashMap` in single-threaded scenarios where thread-safety is not a concern.
   - Use `ConcurrentHashMap` in multi-threaded scenarios where you need thread-safe operations on a map without the need for external synchronization.

In summary, if you're working in a multi-threaded environment, it's safer and more efficient to use `ConcurrentHashMap` to avoid synchronization issues. If you're in a single-threaded environment, or if you're confident in handling external synchronization, you can use `HashMap`.

## 12. Example of Concurrent HashMap

Certainly! Here's a simple example of how to use `ConcurrentHashMap` in Java:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

public class ConcurrentHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a ConcurrentHashMap
        ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> concurrentMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

        // Put elements into the map
        concurrentMap.put("one", 1);
        concurrentMap.put("two", 2);
        concurrentMap.put("three", 3);

        // Access elements concurrently using multiple threads
        Runnable task = () -> {
            for (String key : concurrentMap.keySet()) {
                System.out.println(key + ": " + concurrentMap.get(key));
            }
        };

        // Create multiple threads
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task);

        // Start the threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `ConcurrentHashMap` called `concurrentMap` to store key-value pairs of strings and integers. We put elements into the map and then define a `Runnable` task that iterates through the map's keys and prints the corresponding values.

We create two separate threads, `thread1` and `thread2`, to run the task concurrently. Both threads will access and iterate through the `concurrentMap` without explicit synchronization, thanks to the thread-safe behavior of `ConcurrentHashMap`.

Keep in mind that while `ConcurrentHashMap` provides thread-safe operations, it's important to note that the order of iteration in a `ConcurrentHashMap` is not guaranteed to be in any particular order. The threads may produce output in an interleaved manner due to concurrent execution.

---

## 13. Suppose I have an array List and it's made final, can I add some values in array List?

Yes, you can add values to a `final` ArrayList in Java, but the `final` keyword, when used with an object reference, means that the reference itself cannot be changed to point to a different object. It doesn't mean that the object's content (in this case, the ArrayList's elements) cannot be modified.

For example:

```java
final ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
numbers.add(1);
numbers.add(2);
```

In this code, you're declaring a `final` ArrayList named `numbers`. This means that `numbers` cannot be reassigned to point to a different ArrayList object. However, you can still add, remove, or modify elements within the `numbers` ArrayList.

What you cannot do with a `final` reference is change the reference to point to a different ArrayList:

```java
final ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
numbers = new ArrayList<>(); // This would result in a compilation error
```

So, in summary, you can add values to a `final` ArrayList, but you cannot reassign the `final` reference to a different ArrayList.

## 14. When hashmap is at its capacity how will it grow?

When a hashmap (also known as a hash table) becomes full or reaches a certain threshold of capacity utilization, it needs to be resized in order to maintain efficient performance. The process of resizing a hashmap involves creating a new, larger array (or a list of buckets) and rehashing the existing elements from the old array into the new one. Here's how the process generally works:

1. **Allocate a Larger Array**: When the hashmap's capacity utilization reaches a certain threshold (often called the load factor), the hashmap decides to resize itself. It allocates a new array that is larger in size than the current array. This new array can be twice the size or any other appropriate growth factor.

2. **Rehashing**: Each element in the old array needs to be rehashed to determine its new position in the new array. Rehashing involves applying the hashmap's hash function to the key of each element, which yields an index in the new array. This process ensures that elements are distributed evenly in the new array, which helps maintain the O(1) average time complexity for insertion, deletion, and retrieval.

3. **Copying Elements**: As the elements are rehashed and assigned to their new positions in the larger array, they are typically copied from the old array to the new one. Depending on the implementation, elements might be copied one by one, or blocks of elements might be copied at once to improve efficiency.

4. **Update References**: If the hashmap implementation uses buckets (linked lists, arrays, or other data structures) to handle collisions, these need to be adjusted for the new array size. References to these buckets also need to be updated to point to the new locations in the larger array.

5. **Deallocate Old Array**: Once all elements have been rehashed and moved to the new array, the old array can be deallocated to free up memory.

Resizing the hashmap ensures that the load factor remains within a reasonable range, preventing excessive collisions and maintaining good performance characteristics. The trade-off with resizing is that it takes some time and memory for the rehashing process, but the benefits in terms of long-term performance outweigh this cost.

It's important to choose appropriate load factors and growth factors when designing hashmaps to balance memory usage, insertion/deletion efficiency, and the frequency of resizing operations.

---

## 15. What is ArrayList's underlying structure?

An `ArrayList` is a dynamic array implementation in Java and similar programming languages. It's part of the Java Collections Framework and provides a way to create resizable arrays. The underlying structure of an `ArrayList` is an array, but with dynamic resizing capabilities. Here's how it works:

1. **Array**: At its core, an `ArrayList` uses a regular array to store its elements. This array is created when you instantiate the `ArrayList` and has an initial capacity. This capacity specifies how many elements the `ArrayList` can hold before it needs to be resized.

2. **Dynamic Resizing**: When you add elements to an `ArrayList`, it monitors the number of elements and the current capacity. When the number of elements exceeds the current capacity, the `ArrayList` needs to be resized to accommodate new elements. Resizing involves creating a new, larger array and copying the existing elements from the old array to the new one.

3. **Copying Elements**: During resizing, the `ArrayList` copies the elements from the old array to the new array. This process ensures that the order of elements is maintained. Depending on the implementation, the copying might be done one element at a time or in larger blocks.

4. **Capacity Growth**: When resizing, the new array's size is often increased by a certain growth factor (for example, doubling the size). This strategy helps minimize the number of resize operations, as resizing can be a relatively expensive operation in terms of time complexity.

5. **Data Access**: Accessing elements in an `ArrayList` is fast because it's backed by a regular array. You can directly access an element using its index in constant time.

6. **Insertions and Deletions**: Insertions and deletions in an `ArrayList` can be slower compared to accessing elements, especially if they require shifting elements to make space or fill gaps. Adding an element to the end of the `ArrayList` is usually fast unless a resize operation is triggered.

7. **Memory Overhead**: An `ArrayList` has some memory overhead due to maintaining the dynamic resizing logic and metadata about the array's size and capacity.

In summary, an `ArrayList` provides a convenient way to work with arrays that automatically handles resizing for you. It offers dynamic growth, efficient element access by index, and relatively fast additions/removals. However, it's worth noting that while `ArrayList` is efficient for many use cases, there are scenarios where other data structures like `LinkedList` might be more appropriate due to their constant-time insertions and deletions at both ends.

## 16. What is load factor?
The load factor is a concept used in hash-based data structures, such as hashmaps (also known as hash tables), to determine when to resize the data structure to maintain a good balance between memory usage and performance. The load factor is typically a value between 0 and 1 and represents the ratio of the number of stored elements to the number of available slots (buckets) in the hash table.

In other words, the load factor indicates how "full" the hash table is. As the number of elements in the hash table grows, the load factor increases. When the load factor crosses a certain threshold, it's an indicator that the hash table should be resized to a larger capacity.

Here's the basic idea:

- If the load factor is too low (close to 0), it means that the hash table is using a lot of memory for empty or underutilized slots. This can lead to inefficient memory usage.

- If the load factor is too high (close to 1), it means that the hash table is densely populated, and the probability of collisions (different elements having the same hash) increases. Collisions can degrade the hash table's performance, causing operations like insertion, retrieval, and deletion to become slower.

A common strategy is to set a threshold load factor value (usually around 0.7) that determines when the hash table should be resized. When the load factor exceeds this threshold, the hash table's capacity is increased, and the existing elements are rehashed into the new larger table. This resizing process helps maintain a reasonable balance between memory usage and performance.

For example, if you have a hash table with an initial capacity of 10 and a load factor threshold of 0.7, you would start considering resizing once you have 7 elements in the table. Resizing might involve creating a new hash table with a larger capacity (e.g., 20) and rehashing the existing elements into the new table.

In summary, the load factor is a crucial parameter in determining when to resize a hash-based data structure to ensure that it remains efficient and well-balanced in terms of memory and performance.

`Default load factor:` 
**HashMap - 0.75**
**HashSet - 0.75**

## 17. What about ArrayList's load factor?

`ArrayList` is not a hash-based data structure like `HashMap` or `HashSet`; it's a dynamic array implementation. Therefore, the concept of a load factor does not directly apply to `ArrayList`. Load factors are relevant for hash-based structures to manage the number of elements and the underlying array's capacity.

For `ArrayList`:

1. **Initial Capacity**: When you create an `ArrayList`, you can specify an initial capacity, which is the initial size of the underlying array. If you don't specify an initial capacity, a default initial capacity (usually 10) is used.

2. **Resizing**: As elements are added to an `ArrayList`, if the number of elements exceeds the current capacity of the underlying array, the `ArrayList` resizes itself by creating a new, larger array and copying the existing elements. The resizing strategy typically involves increasing the capacity by a certain factor (e.g., doubling the size) to balance performance and memory usage.

3. **No Load Factor**: Unlike hash-based structures, `ArrayList` doesn't use a load factor to determine when to resize. Instead, it relies on the approach of resizing when the number of elements approaches the current capacity.

In summary, while the concept of a load factor is not applicable to `ArrayList`, it's still important to consider the initial capacity when creating an `ArrayList`. Choosing an appropriate initial capacity can help reduce the number of resize operations and improve the efficiency of adding elements, especially if you have an estimate of the number of elements you plan to store.

## 18. Whats the difference between TreeMap and HashMap?

`TreeMap` and `HashMap` are both implementations of the `Map` interface in Java's Collections Framework, but they have significant differences in terms of their underlying data structures, performance characteristics, and usage scenarios:

1. **Underlying Data Structure**:
   - `TreeMap`: Implemented as a self-balancing binary search tree (usually a red-black tree). This ensures that the keys are always stored in a sorted order based on their natural ordering or a custom comparator.
   - `HashMap`: Implemented as an array of linked lists (buckets) where each bucket contains a list of key-value pairs. It uses the hash code of keys to determine the bucket where a key-value pair is stored.

2. **Ordering**:
   - `TreeMap`: Maintains keys in a sorted order, either based on their natural ordering or a custom comparator provided during construction.
   - `HashMap`: Does not guarantee any specific order of keys or key-value pairs.

3. **Performance**:
   - `TreeMap`: Operations like insertion, retrieval, and deletion have a time complexity of O(log N), where N is the number of elements. This is because the tree structure ensures that the height of the tree remains balanced.
   - `HashMap`: On average, operations have a time complexity of O(1), but this can degrade to O(N) in rare cases if there are many hash collisions. Hash collisions occur when different keys have the same hash code, and their entries end up in the same bucket.

4. **Usage Scenarios**:
   - `TreeMap`: Useful when you need to maintain keys in a sorted order and perform operations such as finding the smallest/largest key, finding keys within a range, or traversing keys in sorted order.
   - `HashMap`: Suitable when you don't need to maintain a specific order of keys and you're focused on efficient key-based retrieval, insertion, and deletion operations.

5. **Memory Overhead**:
   - `TreeMap`: Requires additional memory to store the tree structure, as well as to maintain balance information.
   - `HashMap`: Can be memory-efficient, especially when the load factor is appropriately set to handle hash collisions without excessive resizing.

In summary, choose between `TreeMap` and `HashMap` based on your specific requirements. If you need sorted keys and don't mind a slightly higher memory overhead and slower performance for certain operations, `TreeMap` might be appropriate. If you need fast and efficient key-based operations and order doesn't matter, `HashMap` is likely the better choice.

## 19 What is hashing or rehashing?

-Simple Answer: 

In the context of Java programming, "hashing" and "rehashing" typically refer to operations related to hash tables, which are data structures used to implement associative arrays or maps. Hashing is the process of mapping data (such as keys) to fixed-size values (hash codes) using a hash function. This hash code is then used to index into an array, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of values associated with those keys.

Here's a brief overview of hashing and rehashing:

1. Hashing:
   - Hashing is the initial process of converting a key into a hash code using a hash function. This hash code is used to determine the index in the hash table where the corresponding value should be stored or retrieved.
   - In Java, the `hashCode()` method is used to generate a hash code for an object. This method is defined in the `Object` class and can be overridden in user-defined classes to provide custom hash code generation based on the object's content.
   - A good hash function should distribute hash codes uniformly to minimize collisions (different keys mapping to the same hash code).

2. Rehashing:
   - Rehashing refers to the process of resizing a hash table and reinserting its contents when the number of elements in the hash table exceeds a certain load factor (a predefined threshold).
   - When the load factor is exceeded, the hash table is expanded (or sometimes shrunk) to a new size, typically a prime number, to maintain an acceptable level of performance. This helps avoid too many collisions, which can degrade the efficiency of hash table operations.
   - During rehashing, all existing key-value pairs are hashed again using the new hash table size, and they are redistributed into the new array slots. This process ensures that the distribution of key-value pairs remains even and collisions are minimized.
   - Java's standard library provides implementations of hash tables such as `HashMap` and `HashTable`. These implementations handle rehashing internally when needed.

In summary, hashing in Java involves converting keys into hash codes using hash functions for efficient storage and retrieval in hash tables. Rehashing is the process of resizing and redistributing the elements in a hash table to maintain good performance and minimize collisions as the number of elements grows or shrinks.

Hashing is a technique used in computer science to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values (hash codes) in such a way that accessing, storing, and manipulating the data becomes efficient. Hashing is widely used in data structures like hashmaps (hash tables) to quickly locate and access data based on its key.

Here's how hashing works:

1. **Hash Function**: A hash function takes an input (such as a key) and produces a fixed-size value, typically an integer. The output of the hash function is known as the hash code. A good hash function aims to distribute values evenly across the hash code range to minimize collisions (when different inputs produce the same hash code).

2. **Hash Table**: A hash table (or hashmap) is a data structure that uses hash codes to store and retrieve data efficiently. It consists of an array of buckets, where each bucket can hold one or more key-value pairs.

3. **Storing Data**: When you want to store a key-value pair in a hash table, the hash code of the key is computed using the hash function. The hash code is then used to determine the index (bucket) in the array where the value should be stored.

4. **Retrieving Data**: When you want to retrieve a value based on its key, the hash code of the key is computed again. This hash code is used to locate the correct bucket in the array, and the value associated with that key can be retrieved.

Rehashing, on the other hand, is the process of resizing and reorganizing a hash table when its load factor exceeds a certain threshold. When the load factor becomes too high (meaning the hash table is becoming too full), collisions are more likely to occur, which can degrade performance. Rehashing involves creating a new, larger hash table, recomputing hash codes for all keys, and redistributing the key-value pairs into the new hash table's buckets.

Rehashing typically includes these steps:

1. **Create New Table**: A new, larger array (hash table) is allocated.

2. **Recompute Hash Codes**: The hash codes for all keys in the old table are recomputed using the new hash function.

3. **Reinsert Key-Value Pairs**: Each key-value pair is inserted into the new hash table based on its new hash code.

4. **Replace Old Table**: Once all key-value pairs have been reinserted, the old hash table is discarded, and the new hash table becomes the active one.

Rehashing ensures that the hash table maintains a reasonable load factor, which helps maintain efficient performance by reducing collisions. It's important to choose an appropriate resizing strategy and hash function to ensure good distribution of keys and to minimize the need for frequent rehashing.

# 20. What are hash collisions?

Hash collisions occur when two or more different inputs (such as keys) produce the same hash code when processed by a hash function. In other words, hash collisions occur when two distinct values end up being mapped to the same location (bucket or index) in a hash table.

Hash collisions are an important consideration when working with hash tables and other hash-based data structures. They can have implications for the efficiency and correctness of operations performed on the data structure. Here's why hash collisions matter:

1. **Data Integrity:** Hash tables are used to store key-value pairs, and when hash collisions occur, different keys end up being stored in the same location. This can lead to confusion and incorrect data retrieval if not handled properly.

2. **Performance:** Hash collisions can degrade the performance of hash table operations. When multiple keys map to the same location, the hash table needs a way to distinguish between them. One common approach is to use linked lists or other data structures to store multiple values at the same index. However, if collisions occur frequently, these linked lists can become long, and searching for a specific key within them can become slow, leading to performance degradation.

3. **Efficiency:** The efficiency of hash table operations depends on the distribution of keys and the minimization of collisions. A good hash function and proper handling of collisions (e.g., through techniques like open addressing or chaining) can help maintain efficient operations.

4. **Load Factor:** Hash collisions are closely related to the concept of load factor, which is the ratio of the number of stored elements to the number of available buckets in a hash table. High collision rates can lead to an increased load factor, which in turn can trigger rehashing to maintain acceptable performance.

To address hash collisions, various techniques can be employed:

- **Chaining:** In this technique, each bucket in the hash table contains a linked list or other data structure that holds all the key-value pairs that hash to the same location. This allows multiple values to coexist at the same index.

- **Open Addressing:** In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available slot (by probing) in the hash table to place the conflicting element. There are different strategies within open addressing, such as linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing.

- **Improving Hash Functions:** Designing or selecting a good hash function can reduce the likelihood of collisions by producing hash codes that are more evenly distributed across the available buckets.

Handling hash collisions effectively is crucial to ensure the reliability, performance, and efficiency of hash-based data structures in programming.

# 21. Suppose I have a account class and two instance variables account id and branch id; how can I generate a hashcode which is unique for each account object?

Generating a completely unique hash code for each object is a challenging task, especially within the confines of a hash function. Hash codes are typically based on the contents of an object and are used to distribute objects across hash table buckets, aiming for good performance and even distribution. However, ensuring absolute uniqueness is not feasible in most cases, as hash codes are often constrained to a fixed number of bits.

Instead of aiming for absolute uniqueness, the goal is to generate hash codes that minimize collisions while still providing good distribution. Here's a basic approach you can take to generate hash codes for your `Account` class:

1. **Combine Hash Codes of Instance Variables:** You can generate a hash code for each instance variable (e.g., `accountId` and `branchId`) and then combine them to create a hash code for the entire object.

2. **Prime Numbers:** Incorporate prime numbers to improve the distribution of hash codes and minimize the chance of collisions. Prime numbers are often used to multiply the hash code of each instance variable before combining them.

Here's an example implementation in Java:

```java
public class Account {
    private int accountId;
    private int branchId;

    // Constructor, getters, setters, etc.

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        final int prime = 31; // Choose a prime number
        int result = 1;

        result = prime * result + accountId;
        result = prime * result + branchId;

        return result;
    }

    // Equals method should also be overridden for correct hash table behavior
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) {
            return true;
        }
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) {
            return false;
        }
        Account other = (Account) obj;
        return accountId == other.accountId && branchId == other.branchId;
    }
}
```

In this example, `prime` is chosen as 31. The use of prime numbers helps to spread the hash values across the hash table more evenly, reducing the likelihood of collisions.

Remember that while this approach will help reduce collisions, it still doesn't guarantee absolute uniqueness of hash codes. Hash codes are usually 32-bit or 64-bit integers, and with a limited number of bits, there's a finite number of possible hash codes. Therefore, collisions are still possible, but the goal is to minimize them as much as possible.

Additionally, it's important to override the `equals` method alongside the `hashCode` method to ensure correct behavior when using objects in collections like hash maps or hash sets. The `hashCode` and `equals` methods should be consistent with each other to maintain the contract required for hash-based data structures.

---

# 22. Why would you override the hashcode method? What can be the scenario and need to override it?

Overriding the `hashCode` method in Java is important when you're working with objects that will be used as keys in hash-based data structures such as `HashMap`, `HashSet`, or `Hashtable`. The primary reasons to override the `hashCode` method are:

1. **Proper Functioning of Hash-Based Collections:** Hash-based collections rely on the `hashCode` method to distribute objects efficiently across buckets or slots in the underlying data structure. When you store an object in a hash-based collection, its `hashCode` value is used to determine its location within the collection.

2. **Maintaining Contract with `equals` Method:** If you override the `equals` method in your class to compare objects for equality based on their content, you must also override `hashCode`. This is because the contract for these methods in Java states that if two objects are equal according to the `equals` method, their hash codes must be equal as well. Failing to do so can lead to unexpected behavior in hash-based collections.

Here's a typical scenario in which you'd want to override the `hashCode` method:

**Scenario: Custom Object as a Key in a HashMap**

Suppose you have a custom class `Person` that you want to use as a key in a `HashMap` to associate some data with each person. You've overridden the `equals` method to compare `Person` objects based on their `name` and `age` fields:

```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Constructor, getters, setters, etc.

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) {
            return true;
        }
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) {
            return false;
        }
        Person person = (Person) obj;
        return age == person.age && Objects.equals(name, person.name);
    }
}
```

To use `Person` objects as keys in a `HashMap`, you need to override the `hashCode` method as well:

```java
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(name, age);
}
```

In this example, the `hashCode` method combines the hash codes of the `name` and `age` fields using the `Objects.hash` method. This ensures that two `Person` objects with the same name and age will produce the same hash code, which is required for proper functioning of a `HashMap`.

In summary, you should override the `hashCode` method whenever you override the `equals` method and plan to use instances of your class as keys in hash-based collections. This ensures that your objects are distributed and compared correctly within these collections.

# 23. What happens in case of hash collisions? does it throw a error or it would work but less efficiently?

In the case of hash collisions in Java, it does not throw an error, but it can impact the efficiency and performance of hash-based data structures like `HashMap`, `HashSet`, or `Hashtable`. Java's hash-based collections are designed to handle hash collisions gracefully, and there are strategies in place to manage them. Here's what happens when a hash collision occurs:

1. **Storage in Buckets:** When two or more different objects produce the same hash code (i.e., a collision), they are stored in the same bucket or slot of the hash table. Each bucket can hold multiple key-value pairs.

2. **Equal Hash Codes Do Not Imply Equal Objects:** It's important to note that equal hash codes do not imply equal objects. When hash codes are equal, Java uses the `equals` method to determine if the objects are truly equal. So, even though objects may end up in the same bucket due to hash collisions, they can still be distinguished based on their content.

3. **Performance Impact:** Hash collisions can potentially impact the performance of hash-based collections. When you try to retrieve a value associated with a key, the collection needs to traverse the elements within the bucket, which can be slower if many objects have collided in that bucket.

To mitigate the performance impact of hash collisions, Java's hash-based collections use techniques like:

- **Chaining:** Hash tables typically use an array of buckets, and each bucket can be implemented as a linked list or another data structure to hold multiple key-value pairs that have the same hash code. When you look up a key, the collection searches the corresponding bucket for the desired key-value pair.

- **Load Factor and Rehashing:** Hash-based collections dynamically adjust their size and the number of buckets to maintain an acceptable load factor (the ratio of elements to buckets). When the load factor exceeds a certain threshold, the collection is resized (rehashed) to distribute the elements more evenly across the buckets, reducing the chance of collisions.

So, while hash collisions can occur and are managed without throwing errors, excessive collisions can lead to performance degradation. It's important to choose or implement a good hash function and keep an eye on the load factor to ensure efficient and effective use of hash-based collections.

# 24. Difference between HashMap and Linked HashMap in java?

In Java, `HashMap` and `LinkedHashMap` are two commonly used implementations of the `Map` interface, which provides a way to store key-value pairs. While both of them share the basic functionality of storing and retrieving key-value pairs, they differ in terms of how they maintain the order of elements and their performance characteristics.

Here are the key differences between `HashMap` and `LinkedHashMap`:

1. **Ordering of Elements**:
   - `HashMap`: `HashMap` does not guarantee any specific order of the elements. The order of elements may appear arbitrary and can change when elements are added or removed. It is not suitable if you need to maintain a specific order of elements.
   - `LinkedHashMap`: `LinkedHashMap` maintains the insertion order of elements. When you iterate over the elements, they will be returned in the order in which they were added. This makes it suitable for scenarios where you need to maintain the order of insertion.

2. **Performance**:
   - `HashMap`: `HashMap` generally offers better performance for basic operations like inserting, deleting, and retrieving elements because it does not have the overhead of maintaining order. It has O(1) average-case time complexity for these operations.
   - `LinkedHashMap`: `LinkedHashMap` has slightly worse performance than `HashMap` for basic operations because it has to maintain the order of elements using a linked list. While it is still very efficient, it may have slightly higher overhead. The time complexity for basic operations is also O(1) on average.

3. **Memory Usage**:
   - `HashMap`: `HashMap` typically consumes less memory than `LinkedHashMap` because it does not need to store the additional linked list for maintaining order. If memory usage is a concern, `HashMap` might be a better choice.

4. **Iterating Order**:
   - `HashMap`: The order of elements when iterating over a `HashMap` is not predictable and is not guaranteed to be in any specific order.
   - `LinkedHashMap`: When you iterate over a `LinkedHashMap`, the elements will be returned in the order in which they were inserted.

In summary, if you need to maintain the order of elements or require predictable iteration order, `LinkedHashMap` is a better choice. If you don't need to maintain order and performance is a primary concern, then `HashMap` is usually more efficient. Your choice between them should be based on the specific requirements of your application.

Certainly! Here's a code sample that demonstrates the usage of both `HashMap` and `LinkedHashMap` in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class HashMapVsLinkedHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a HashMap
        Map<String, Integer> hashMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Adding key-value pairs to the HashMap
        hashMap.put("Alice", 25);
        hashMap.put("Bob", 30);
        hashMap.put("Charlie", 28);
        hashMap.put("David", 35);

        System.out.println("HashMap elements (no guaranteed order):");
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : hashMap.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
        }

        // Creating a LinkedHashMap
        Map<String, Integer> linkedHashMap = new LinkedHashMap<>();

        // Adding key-value pairs to the LinkedHashMap
        linkedHashMap.put("Alice", 25);
        linkedHashMap.put("Bob", 30);
        linkedHashMap.put("Charlie", 28);
        linkedHashMap.put("David", 35);

        System.out.println("\nLinkedHashMap elements (maintains insertion order):");
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : linkedHashMap.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}
```

In this code sample, we first create a `HashMap` and a `LinkedHashMap`, adding key-value pairs to both of them. Then, we iterate over the entries of each map and print them. The key difference you'll notice is that the `HashMap` iteration order is not guaranteed to be in the order of insertion, while the `LinkedHashMap` maintains the insertion order when iterating.
