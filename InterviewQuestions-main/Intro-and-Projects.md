**Introduction:**

"Hello, my name is Abhishek Kudal, I'm a passionate coder. and I'm excited to be here today to discuss my experience and how I can contribute to [Company Name]. I have a background in software engineering with a focus on Java and related technologies. With nearly 3 years of experience, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects that have honed my skills in developing efficient applications, designing user-friendly interfaces, and implementing secure RESTful APIs."

**Experience:**

"In my current role as a Software Engineering Specialist at Dassault Syst√®mes, I've been responsible for developing internal applications using technologies such as Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL. These applications have significantly improved efficiency and streamlined workflows within the company. I've been able to create user-friendly interfaces using Spring Forms, Roles based access controls.

"In addition, I've designed and implemented REST APIs that have increased integration with other applications and systems by 25%.

**Projects:**

"Let me provide you with a closer look at a couple of the projects I've worked on to demonstrate how I apply my skills in real-world scenarios."

**1. E-commerce Plugin:**

"This project involved developing a system using Spring Boot and MySQL to recover abandoned carts for e-commerce brands within the organization. I created webhooks to trigger customized messages for customers who added products to their carts but didn't complete the checkout process. By implementing a scheduled events table and a scheduler service, I ensured that SMS and email messages were sent to customers on a timely basis until they either completed the purchase or all scheduled messages were sent."

**2. Platform News:**

"In this project, I contributed to our internal platform application by building a RESTful API using Spring Boot. The goal was to highlight posts with maximum interest from a pool of communities and posts. I incorporated caching using Caffeine Cache to store and serve the top 10 stories for 15 minutes, optimizing response times. Additionally, I developed endpoints that returned top stories, past stories, and top comments on specific stories, all sorted by the total number of comments, including child comments."

**Certifications:**

"Beyond my practical experience, I've also invested in my professional growth through certifications. I hold certifications in Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals, Spring Framework, and both Java and SQL Software Engineer Certifications at Level 1 from R&D."

**Closing:**

"I'm eager to bring my skills and experiences to the team at [Company Name] and contribute to the innovative projects you're working on. I believe my expertise in Java/J2EE, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL, combined with my commitment to delivering impactful solutions, aligns well with your company's objectives. Thank you for considering my application."
