## What is Earliest vs latest in kafka?

In the context of Apache Kafka, "earliest" and "latest" refer to two different options for specifying the starting offset when consuming messages from a topic. Let's break down what they mean:

1. **Earliest**:
   - When you specify the "earliest" offset option while consuming messages from a Kafka topic, it means you want to start reading messages from the very beginning of the topic, from the earliest available offset.
   - If you subscribe to a topic with the "earliest" offset option, your consumer will read all the messages in the topic, starting from the first message that was ever produced.

   Example (in Kafka consumer configuration):
   ```properties
   auto.offset.reset=earliest
   ```

2. **Latest**:
   - On the other hand, when you specify the "latest" offset option, it means you want to start reading messages from the latest offset available in the topic.
   - If you subscribe to a topic with the "latest" offset option, your consumer will only read messages that are produced after the consumer has started.

   Example (in Kafka consumer configuration):
   ```properties
   auto.offset.reset=latest
   ```

Choosing between "earliest" and "latest" depends on your use case:

- Use **"earliest"** when you want to process all the historical data in the topic, including messages that were produced before the consumer started. This is useful for scenarios where you need to backfill data or reprocess historical records.

- Use **"latest"** when you are only interested in new messages, and you don't want to process old data. This is common in real-time processing applications where you want to focus on the most recent events.

It's important to choose the appropriate offset reset option based on your specific application requirements to ensure you are processing the data in the way that makes sense for your use case.
